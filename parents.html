            Welcome! This page is a brief introduction to the ones who decided this world needed another disgruntled IT worker, my parents.

        <p>
            My father was born in Kansas City in November of 1956. He would spend his childhood years moving from town to town until his parents settled down in Ralston, NE. After high school, Kim would join the Army. His Army days took him all around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mother was born in Omaha in May of 1962. From there, Cathy would grow up to be a rambunctious scamp that terrorized the neighborhood from her 65 Schwinn Speedster. Cathy would go on to graduate from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln with a bachelors in Elementary Education.

        <p>
            The happy couple met in 1980 and would soon begin dating. A few Van Halen concerts later, the two would find themselves ready to begin a committed and legally binding relationship. Kim and Cathy wasted no time in starting their family. They welcomed their first son into the world in June of 1985. And the rest is history.... on the other pages!
