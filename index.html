            About us
        </h2>
        <p>
            My family started "officially" in 1984 when my parents got married. A year later, their first son, Nick, was born. After that, the rugrats kept on coming. Like most families, we have seen our ups
             and downs, but we have always kept our heads up. The Schultz's have been based in West Point, NE since 1991, but the kids have migrated to more happening cities.
